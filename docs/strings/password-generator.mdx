# Password Generator

After attending a cybersecurity seminar, you learned about the risks of reusing the same or similar-looking passwords across multiple platforms. To address this issue, you decided that using a password generator would be the best solution. However, because you don't completely trust online password generators, you chose to create your own software.

## Features

After careful consideration and research you come up with a list of requirements for your application:

- It should prompt the user whether or not he wants to include/exclude **uppercase characters**, **lowercase characters**, **special characters** and/or **digits** in his password.
- It should prompt the user for the length of the password.
- It should be equipped with basic error handling. *What happens if the user does not input what was expected?*

## Demo Example

## Supporting Resources

If you are experiencing some difficulties, don't worry, its normal. Take a peek into the supporting resources and reorganize your ideas, good luck!

<summary>Language-independent hints</summary>

- Think about constructing a character set with all character groups selected by the user. For example, if the user only wants numbers and special characters your program would **dynamically** create a character set only with numbers and special characters.

- Try to find a library of the programming language you are using that lets you generate random numbers. Then, based on that random number select a character from the character set. Do this as many times as the length requested by the user.
