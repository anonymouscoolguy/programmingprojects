# Hello, world!

This is a *repository of programming projects*. 

This project aims to create a collection of programming projects, *(ideally)* complete with guidelines and walkthroughs. The idea is that individuals of various skill levels can use this repository to find practice projects and enhance their understanding of programming concepts.

## Structure

Projects are organized into categories, which can be found on the sidebar of this website. Within each category, projects are ordered by their difficulty. There exist three levels of difficulty a project can be assigned to, namely:

- <span class="badge badge--success">Beginner-friendly</span>
- <span class="badge badge--warning">Intermediate</span>
- <span class="badge badge--danger">Hard</span>

Additionally, each project will resemble the following structure:

1. Introduction
2. Features
3. Demo Example
4. Supporting Resources

## Contributing

I ([@anonymouscoolguy](https://github.com/anonymouscoolguy)) envision this project to become community-driven. So, if you believe to have a nice addition or if you could help with translation, your contributions would be welcome. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/anonymouscoolguy/programmingprojects) page. Thank you.

## Have fun

Learning is a long, never-ending process, so don't forget to have fun. Good luck!
